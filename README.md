# KBG-TEST-FA
This is a simple web app for a test.

# Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd frontend` and `npm install` to install dependencies
3. `npm run dev` to start the development server
4. Frontend will be running in the designated port (will appear in console)
4. `cd backend` and `npm install` to install dependencies
5. `npm run dev` to start the development server
6. Backend will be running in `http://localhost:3005` (will also appear in console)
7. Open the frontend in your browser.
8. Upload the petri pictures.
9. Check the results.

**Extra**: If you want to check the OpenCV implementation (not fully working) some workaround is needed, but you should point to `checkZoI` instead of `zoiUpload`, as well as pip install opencv-python to install the OpenCV library.

I also left some png leftover from my tests with the OpenCV implementation, but they are not needed for the app to work.
